**Problem**
Alice wants to send a message to Bob but doesn't want Eve to read it. So decides to encrypt it using a scheme. This scheme follows the following rule:
A = ._
B = _...
C = _._.
D = _..
E = .
F = .._.
G = __.
H = ....
I = ..
J = .___
K = _._
L = ._..
M = __
N = _.
O = ___
P = .__.
Q = __._
R = ._.
S = ...
T = _
U = .._
V = ..._
W = .__
X = _.._
Y = _.__
Z = __..


**For example,**
"__.._...__" is the word "GREAT". Unfortunately, this
sequence also decrypts to 'GAEEAT', 'GAEEEM', 'MEAIW', 'TTELW', 'ZTEUT', etc., along
with many others. To solve this problem, Alice asks you to find a
solution while she works on developing her own language.

**Input**
The input will be a string of encrypted message.

**Output**
Print all of the possible decodings, separated by newlines,
in alphabetical order.

**Example**
STDIN
_.__.

**STDOUT:**
KN
KTE
NG
NME
NTN
NTTE
TAN
TATE
TEG
TEME
TETN
TETTE
TP
TWE
YE
